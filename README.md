# Dronekit, ogent style

based on https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-python
The original is based on an Apache licence. 

- Made much more readable (subjectively)
- "Streamlined" files, many hadn't been touched for years and I'll be refering to the main documentation.
- Last update to date with the master in ~ february 2021
- Allows me to modify the library more easily for the UAS application
